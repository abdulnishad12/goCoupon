A Go API, backed by Redis, to manage coupons, promotional codes and referrals..

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/goCoupon
```

### Testing

Need to add tests.

``make test``
